# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? fucking awesome!!!! I loved the challenge and enjoyed putting all the pieces together.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? Should do better about taking breaks as it will help with staying focused
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1? Not to be so hard on myself. I know it takes repetition and practice before feeling confident with new concepts and this all comes with time.
